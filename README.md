##A crypto currency trading bot ##
A humble attempt to calculate taxes for all the trading i did on gdax, kraken, bittrex and binance.


### How do I get set up? ###

- Install python 3.5, python-virtualenv and python-pip.
- Create a project directory and pull the source
- Setup a virtual env in the terminal:

```bash
mkdir -p $VIRTUAL_ENV
virtualenv --python=/usr/bin/python3.5 $VIRTUAL_ENV
source $VIRTUAL_ENV/bin/activate
# install from PyPI read requirements.txt
pip install -r requirements.txt
```


To deactivate the virtual env cmd in terminal:
```bash
deactivate
```

Run this command everytime:
```bash
source .virtualenv/CrytoTaxKitty/bin/activate
```

There will be a better way, soon. <br />
Something called brew automatically calls activate. Haven't looked into it yet.

To run tests:

Update the exchange keys.

Change your working directory to "tests" folder

Run a test case Ex: .py.
